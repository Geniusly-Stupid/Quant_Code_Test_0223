# Quant_Code_Test_0223

This repository contains my solution to the Quant Code Test. The project includes a C++ program that reads an input CSV file containing trade data, computes various statistics for each financial symbol, and writes the results to an output CSV file.

## Input & Output Format
- **Input:** `<TimeStamp>,<Symbol>,<Quantity>,<Price>`
- **Output:** `<symbol>,<MaxTimeGap>,<Volume>,<WeightedAveragePrice>,<MaxPrice>`

## Total Time Spend

- Approximately 40 minutes.
